#About me 

I am a Computer Engineer with 12 years of teaching experience. During this time, I gave trainings on many subjects and learned new things. I prepared my students for many robotic projects. Some of them are FRC, PiWars, MEB Robot. In these projects, I used development boards such as RoboRIO, Raspberry pi 3, Arduino. I also took IoT trainings. I used programming languages â€‹â€‹such as C++, Java and Python in these projects.

My curiosity and interest always pushed me to learn new things in the field of Information Technologies. My enthusiasm led me to improve my CompTIA Security+, Data Science, Full-stack software development skills.

During my Data Science education, I signed many projects. You can check out some of them on my Github hash. I am an analytical, curious person who loves to hypothesize strong data models. I have used many tools such as Python, SQL, Git, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Pandas (Software), Seaborn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch in my project development processes.

In addition to all these, I am also familiar with tools such as Cyber â€‹â€‹Security, Network systems and routing, Server operating systems (windows 2012), Open-source operating systems (pardus).
